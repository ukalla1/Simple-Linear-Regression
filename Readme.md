This project is the implementation of a simple linear regression in python using the scikit learn library
The following are the goals of the code:
	1. To read a CSV file with the data inputs.
	2. Store the data into 2 variables based on dependent and independent vars (Here, it is assumed that the data has independent vars in all but the last column, with the data itself having 2 columns).
	3. Split the data into train and test data.
	4. Perform linear regression on the training data using the LinearRegression class from scikit learn.
	5. Check the fitted line on the test data to check the correctness of the data.

Note: Include print statements to check the flow of the code.
